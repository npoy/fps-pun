## Description

This is a quick proof of concept of an free person shooter game based on the *"Learn To Create An Online Multiplayer Game In Unity"* Udemy course created by [James Doyle]([/guides/content/editing-an-existing-page](https://www.udemy.com/user/james-doyle-4/))

The course is pretty straightforward and has almost no pattern or code organization applied so it works just as an entry level example.

A branch with a refactor will be added to this repository later.
